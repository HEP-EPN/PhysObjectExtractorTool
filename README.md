# Physics Objects Extractor Tool (POET)

## Description

The POET repository contains packages that verse instructions and examples on how to extract physics (objects) information and methods or tools needed for processing them.  These objects can be: electrons, muons, photons, jets, tracks, etc.  Choose the appropriate `branch` for a given CMS Open Data epochs/format.  Currently, these are:

* `master`: for Run II (extraction from AOD) CMS open/legacy data.  In development.
* `2015MiniAOD`: for Run II (extraction from miniAOD) CMS open/legacy data.  In development.
* `2012`: for Run I (extraction from AOD format) CMS open/legacy data.  Already quite functional but still in development.
* `2011`: for Run I (extraction from AOD format) CMS open/legacy data.  Currently a placeholder for 2011 data manipulation, which needs a few modifications compared to 2012 

Please check out the `README` in each package for further instructions.
